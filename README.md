# Cityscape
This repository contains a Java program that generates a cityscape animation. The animation includes buildings, windows, a car, a user-controllable UFO flying across the screen, and other UFOs in the sky.

## Features
- The cityscape animation is rendered using Java's Swing library.
- Buildings of various heights are displayed on the screen. 
- Windows are randomly placed on the buildings.
- A car moves horizontally across the screen.
- A UFO flies in the sky and changes direction upon reaching the screen boundaries.
- The user's UFO can bump into the other UFOs
- The UFO can emit a beam of light.
- The car can be trapped by the UFO's beam.

## Prerequisites
To run the cityscape animation program, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.
- Java Swing: Utilized for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) components and rendering the simulation.

## Getting Started
To get started with the cityscape animation, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
- Open the project in your Java IDE.
- Build the project to compile the source code.
- Run the main class to start the animation.

## Customization
You can customize various aspects of the cityscape animation to suit your preferences. Here are a few examples:

- Adjust the width and height of the frame in the main class to change the size of the animation window.
- Modify the properties of buildings, windows, cars, and UFOs in their respective classes to change their appearance or behavior.
- Experiment with different colors, shapes, and sizes to create your own unique cityscape.
